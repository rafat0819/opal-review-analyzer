=== PLATFORM TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE: TECHNICAL & OPERATIONAL ISSUES ===

ISSUE ID: AUTH_FAILURE (Login or API Token Error)
Category: Technical
Cause: Most often due to an expired or corrupted session token, or a mismatch in the local machine's system time.
Solution: 
1. Clear browser cookies and cache completely.
2. Attempt login using a Private/Incognito window to bypass local extensions.
3. Verify the system time and date settings on the local machine are correct (time drift causes token rejection).
4. If the error persists, generate a new API token via the Profile Settings panel.

ISSUE ID: DASHBOARD LOADING SLOW (HIGH LATENCY)
Category: Performance
Cause: Excessive data volume being requested for visualization. Performance dashboards often slow when requesting over 500,000 data points (e.g., requesting data for a year or more).
Solution: 
1. **Primary Fix:** Reduce the date range filter to "Last 30 Days" or "Last Quarter" only.
2. Check if multiple high-volume data widgets (like detailed funnel reports) are loading simultaneously. Temporarily disable high-latency widgets.
3. Change the data aggregation setting from "Hourly" to "Daily" to reduce the number of points requested.

ISSUE ID: EXPORT BUTTON GRAYED OUT/EXPORT FAILS
Category: Permissions/Usage
Cause: This is strictly a user permissions failure. The current user likely lacks the required "Export" or "Admin" role needed to download sensitive raw data.
Solution:
1. Verify the user's current role in the Administration panel (Settings > User Management).
2. Ensure the user holds the "Analyst" or "Admin" role (Viewer roles cannot export raw data).
3. If the role is correct, check if the export file size exceeds the platform's 1GB limit.

ISSUE ID: DATA INTEGRATION FAILURE (CAMPAIGN DATA MISSING)
Category: Data Ingestion
Cause: This is commonly a firewall block or an expired key in the external API connector (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot).
Solution:
1. Check the Integration Status Dashboard for the specific connector (e.g., HubSpot Connector).
2. Verify that the client's Firewall (or IP whitelist) is allowing our external API calls.
3. Rerun the initial data synchronization job via the Data Integration Settings page.

ISSUE ID: CONTENT GENERATION IS TOO GENERIC (AI QUALITY)
Category: AI Quality/Guidance
Cause: The AI model lacks sufficient context (i.e., the specific brand voice or proprietary product details).
Solution:
1. Advise the user to upload more internal documents to the agent's knowledge base (e.g., brand guidelines, specific product documentation).
2. Encourage users to include specific **Product IDs** or **Tone of Voice** parameters in their prompts to steer the AI.

ISSUE ID: NEW FEATURE REQUEST / ROADMAP INQUIRY
Category: Guidance/Product
Cause: Users seeking information on future product capabilities.
Solution:
1. Check the official "Public Roadmap" documentation (internal link only).
2. If the feature is not listed, submit the request as a low-priority ticket labeled 'Feature Request' to the Product Team for consideration.
